##13.  Extracting Files from a JAR File

1.  Open a command line with administrator rights

2.  Start->All Programs->Accessories

3.  Right-mouse click on Command Prompt and select Administrator

4.  Navigate to c:\program files\java\jdk-10.0.1\bin

5.  jar xf c:\users\julie\sample\02\demo.jar

6.  Folder "com" will be in the bin directory.  Move it accordingly

7.  Couldn't figure out how to run from the samples directory since "jar" was not in the path and couldn't figure out how to run a command with "program files" in the name.
