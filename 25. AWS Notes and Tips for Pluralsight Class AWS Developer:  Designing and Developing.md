#25. AWS Notes and Tips for Pluralsight Class AWS Developer:  Designing and Developing.md

1.  For EC2 startups, the logs are found in /var/log/cloud-init-output.log (use arrow keys to navigate, rather than mouse slide bar).

2.  To shut down an Instance created from AutoScaling, set the AutoScaling min and desired to zero.

3.  For the Pluralsight training Node programs, the logs are found in the /.forever/ directory.  Use ls -ltr to sort files by last updated date.

4.  Connecting to an AWS MySqlServer is easy -- the hostname is found on the mysql database definition "end point" and the port is 3306.

5.  Cloudfront needed to have the S3 files re-uploaded and the DynamoDB recreated in order for the files to be loaded from the Cloudfront path.

6.  The mainball image will take some time to load from the S3 as it's loading up into Cloudfront.

View of how an Image, Launch Instance, Load Balancer, Listener, Target Group, and AutoScaling Group are connected:

7.  Needed to install stream-buffers for SQS to work with the following command (add to user data on next LC creation):

npm install stream-buffers --save

9.  For the SQS module, had to do a ton of work to actually get the hamster table updated with the race simulation restuls.  Kept getting the "hamster.put is not a valid function" error message, so had to basically rewrite the sqs.listener.js program to actually do the table updates in that routine.

10.  git pull origin <branch_name> to get branch!

10.  Add this to user data to get the code for a launch configuration:

git clone https://github.com/JACjava/hbfl-master.git --branch Messaging-Inside-AWS-3 --single-branch

11.  The consumer for the Kinesis stream module is supposed to take the race results and update the race table rather than the hamster table.  Kinesis is real time and that will require a consumer that can react -- this will be done through a lambda function.

8.  In the create-kinesis-consumer.js, in the createLambda function, the runtime routine needs to be changed from nodejs6.10 to nodejs10.x

8.  Rerunning the create-kinesis-consumer.js job proved problematic, as the IAM role needed more time to finish creating.  Re-running entailed deleting the role first.

9.  The lambda-kinesis-consumer-role needed two additional permissions not specified in the code:  AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess (the database functions failed without this) and AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole (to put logs in Cloudwatch) in addition to AmazonKinesisReadOnlyAccess.

9.  Lambda logs are found in either the Lambda console or Cloudwatch.
