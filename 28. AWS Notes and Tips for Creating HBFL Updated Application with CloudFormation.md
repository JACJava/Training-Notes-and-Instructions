## 28. AWS Notes and Tips for Creating HBFL Updated Application with CloudFormation

## Steps to run the production app:

1.  Start the EC2 instance
2.  Create the kinesis stream using the cloudformation template:  aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.kinesis.template --stack-name hbfl-kinesis-stack
2.  Log into the instance using Putty with the ec2-user id and the information on the "connect" screen
3.  cd hbfl-master
4.  npm run start
5.  app will be running on public ip address at port 3000
6.  ps -ef |grep hbfl

## Replacing the Kinesis Stream with newly-created one from Cloudformation:

1.  Create Kinesis Stream hamster-race-results2 with cloudformation template by running this command:

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.kinesis.template --stack-name hbfl-kinesis-stack

2.  From the console, update the hamster-kinesis-stream-consumer Lambda function to have the HRR2 kinesis stream as a trigger:

select add trigger
select kinesis from the drop down
select hamster-race-results2 from the stream drop down
leave the other fields as defaults, including enable
click Add
disable hamster-race-results

3.  Update the resolution.js program to point to hamster-race-results2:

const KINESIS_STREAM_NAME = 'hamster-race-results2'

4.  Push the code up to github and bring up the EC2 instance

5.  From the EC2 instance, in the hbfl-master directory:

git pull origin HBFL-Complete-Application-with-Cloud-Formation

6.  Start the app with:  npm run start

7.  Point the browser to:  ip-address:3000

8.  Clear results and re-run simulation

9.  Delete the hrr2 stream with this command:

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name hbfl-kinesis-stack

10.  Re-create hrr stream and re-point the code to it and re-test

## Process to create the app with cloud formation

1.  Dev Hamster EC2 is now Production

2.  Use the start.template to create the shell application, but point to the user data from the latest application that's running on the load balancer
