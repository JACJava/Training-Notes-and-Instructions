## 28. AWS Notes and Tips for Creating HBFL Updated Application with CloudFormation

## Steps to run the production app manually:

1.  Start the EC2 instance ("Production Hamster")
2.  Create the kinesis stream using the cloudformation template:  aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.kinesis.template --stack-name hbfl-kinesis-stack 
2.  Latest template is in AWS-Developer-Deployment-and-Security repository in branch Production-HBFL-with-Cloud-Formation
2.  Latest application code is in hbfl-master repository in branch Communicating-with-AWS
2.  Update the Lambda function to enable the Kinesis Stream (default is disabled -- don't forget to SAVE at the top of the screen).
2.  Log into the instance using Putty with the ec2-user id and the information on the "connect" screen
3.  cd hbfl-master
4.  npm run start
5.  app will be running on public ip address at port 3000
6.  ps -ef |grep hbfl

## Steps to run the production app automatically from cloudformation:

2.  Create the hbfl application (EC2, LB, ASG, Kinesis, RDS database and required security) using the cloudformation template and following command from :  aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.updated.template --stack-name hbfl-stack-cf --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
2.  Latest template is hbfl.updated.template in the AWS-Developer-Deployment-and-Security repository in branch Production-HBFL-with-Cloud-Formation
2.  Latest application code is in hbfl-master repository in branch Communicating-with-AWS
2.  Application will start up automatically because userdata has been specified for each instance
2.  Update the Lambda function to enable the Kinesis Stream (default is disabled -- don't forget to SAVE at the top of the screen).  No longer need to do this as the cloud formation template has been updated to include the Lambda function creation using code in
      "S3Bucket" : "hamster-lambda-function",
      "S3Key" : "function.zip",
2.  Access the application from the ELB ARN, the EC2 instance public IP address(es) at port 3000 (e.g. 11.123.22.333:3000), or the Route53 DNS name.
2.  Tests -- ensure hamster (SQS) and race tables (Kinesis) get updated with results. and then results cleared.

## Replacing the Kinesis Stream with newly-created one from Cloudformation:

1.  Create Kinesis Stream hamster-race-results2 with cloudformation template by running this command:

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.kinesis.template --stack-name hbfl-kinesis-stack

2.  From the console, update the hamster-kinesis-stream-consumer Lambda function to have the HRR2 kinesis stream as a trigger:

select add trigger
select kinesis from the drop down
select hamster-race-results2 from the stream drop down
leave the other fields as defaults, including enable
click Add
disable hamster-race-results

3.  Update the resolution.js program to point to hamster-race-results2:

const KINESIS_STREAM_NAME = 'hamster-race-results2'

4.  Push the code up to github and bring up the EC2 instance

5.  From the EC2 instance, in the hbfl-master directory:

git pull origin HBFL-Complete-Application-with-Cloud-Formation

6.  Start the app with:  npm run start

7.  Point the browser to:  ip-address:3000

8.  Clear results and re-run simulation

9.  Delete the hrr2 stream with this command:

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name hbfl-kinesis-stack

10.  Re-create hrr stream and re-point the code to it and re-test

## Process to create the app with cloud formation

1.  Dev Hamster EC2 is now Production

2.  Use the start.template to create the shell application, but point to the user data from the latest application that's running on the load balancer

3.  The latest launch configuration is hamsterLCCopyMessagingInsideAWWCopy, that's where the latest user data is taken from, and the branch is:

git clone https://github.com/JACjava/hbfl-master.git --branch Communicating-with-AWS --single-branch

4.  To get the encoded user data in the correct format for use in the CF template:

aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations --launch-configuration-names hamsterLCCopyMessagingInsideAWWCopy

encoded user data is in the json file

5.  Copy the start.template to hbfl.completeapp.template and change all the resources to end with CF to distinguish them from prior versions.

6.  Run the command:
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.completeapp.template --stack-name hbfl-stack-cf --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

7.  To update the stack and see the changes without executing:
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.completeapp.template --stack-name hbfl-stack-cf --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --no-execute-changeset

8.  To update the stack and execute the changes:
aws cloudformation execute-change-set --change-set-name arn:aws.....

8.  Run the load_s3_files.bat file (note that this assumes the "application.min.js" and "stylesheet.css" files have been created in the public directory -- this is created by running "npm run start" on the local machine...even tho the script doesn't work on windows!!!!!!)

9.  To delete the stack:

delete_s3_files.bat

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name hbfl-stack-cf

9.  To encode user data into base64 use:  https://www.base64encode.net/

## Process to load files to S3

1.  See load_s3_files.bat

2.  Note that this assumes the "application.min.js" and "stylesheet.css" files have been created in the public directory -- this is created by running "npm run start" on the local machine...even tho the script doesn't work on windows!!!!!!)

3.  For some reason, the three main screen hamster images are still being picked up from Cloudfront...why...but don't have time to debug.

4.  Stopped here for now...too many bugs in the code...moving on to the Udemy training...
