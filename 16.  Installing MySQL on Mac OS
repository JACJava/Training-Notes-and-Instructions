#16.  Installing MySQL on Mac OS

Very helpful YouTube video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=UcpHkYfWarM

1.  Download MySQL Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=485470

2.  Update the .bash_profile file in home directory (command is:  open .bash_profile):

        export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/

4.  Reload the .bash_profile file using the source command:  source .bash_profile

5.  mysql -u root -p

6.  <enter password>

7.  To change password:  ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<new pwd>';

8.  Download MySQL Workbench

9.  Copy to Applications

10.  Log in with root password

11.  Note:  to see if MySQL is running Apple->System Preferences->MySQL

12.  Had to set SET GLOBAL time_zone = '-6:00'; to avoid compilation error with java program...didn't need to do this in Windows, so confusing.

13.  Alternative way of solving was to do this, but I didn't like hardcoding the timezone in the program:

private String jdbcURL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/book_store?serverTimezone=CST6CDT"
