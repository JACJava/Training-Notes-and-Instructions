#25. AWS Notes and Tips

1.  For EC2 startups, the logs are found in /var/log/cloud-init-output.log (use arrow keys to navigate, rather than mouse slide bar).

2.  To shut down an Instance created from AutoScaling, set the AutoScaling min and desired to zero.

3.  For the Pluralsight training Node programs, the logs are found in the /.forever/ directory.  Use ls -ltr to sort files by last updated date.

4.  Connecting to an AWS MySqlServer is easy -- the hostname is found on the mysql database definition "end point" and the port is 3306.

5.  Cloudfront needed to have the S3 files re-uploaded and the DynamoDB recreated in order for the files to be loaded from the Cloudfront path.

6.  Open task -- the mainball image will not load from the S3 -- why not???  caching problem???
