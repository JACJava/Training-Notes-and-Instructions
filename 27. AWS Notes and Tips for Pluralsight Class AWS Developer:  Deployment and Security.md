#27. AWS Notes and Tips for Pluralsight Class AWS Developer:  Deployment and Security

1.  To get the user data from a launch configuration use the following command:

aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations --launch-configuration-names <configuration name> --output json

2.  The output from the above command will list the user data used to create the LC.

2.  Check on aws configure to see if json is case sensitive...the above command gave an error about "JSON" not being a valid output type.  This was true!  Was a mistake -- had UPPERCASE JSON as the default output type during the "aws configure" setup...needed to be lowercase json.  With that change, the --output json parameter is not needed.
