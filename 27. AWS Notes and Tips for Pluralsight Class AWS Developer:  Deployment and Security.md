#27. AWS Notes and Tips for Pluralsight Class AWS Developer:  Deployment and Security

1.  To get the user data from a launch configuration use the following command:

aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations --launch-configuration-names <configuration name> --output json

2.  The output from the above command will list the user data used to create the LC.

2.  Check on aws configure to see if json is case sensitive...the above command gave an error about "JSON" not being a valid output type.  This was true!  Was a mistake -- had UPPERCASE JSON as the default output type during the "aws configure" setup...needed to be lowercase json.  With that change, the --output json parameter is not needed.

2.  Command for aws cloudformation deploy is:  

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.start.template --stack-name hbfl-stack --parameter-overrides ImageIdParameter=ami-0c64dd618a49aeee8 VPCIdParameter=vpc-0164826a SubnetListParameter=subnet-bda2acd5,subnet-951a5def --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

2.  Command for aws cloudformation create changeset (but not execute) is:

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file hbfl.start.template --stack-name hbfl-stack --parameter-overrides InstanceTypeParameter=t2.nano --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --no-execute-changeset

3.  For Coordinating Services in AWS for the serverless function, needed to install:

npm install -g serverless

 +--------------------------------------------------+
 |                                                  |
 |  Serverless Framework successfully installed!    |
 |  To start your first project, run “serverless”.  |
 |                                                  |
 +--------------------------------------------------+
 
 4.  The lambda serverless function didn't work with nodejs6.10, and had to be changed to nodejs10.x (just like it had to be done in the prior course with the lambda function.  The serverless.yml file had to be changed:
 
 provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs10.x
  region: ${file(./region.js)}

5.  The S3 files did not upload correctly through the serverless program due to some error.  Rather than spend the time debugging it, upload the S3 files from s3/incoming/* . json to the S3 bucket -- note that this did not work either -- but maybe because the s3 bucket needed to have the incoming/ directory in it.  Will try again next time...
